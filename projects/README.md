# Probabilistic Programming Projects by Summer School Participants

Organized by probabilistic programming language used.

To submit a project:

1. fork this repo on GitHub and clone your fork.
2. create a subdirectory in the appropriate language subdirectory
   named after your team or project. E.g., use
   `:/projects/anglican/<team or project name>` for Anglican projects.
3. copy your project files into your directory and commit (feel free
   to preserve the Git history if you're into that sort of thing and
   know how).
4. submit a pull request.

After we receive your pull request, we'll merge your project and give
you push access to this project repo, in case you want to make further
changes directly.
